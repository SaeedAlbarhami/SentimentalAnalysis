Yaml based configuration and first class command line integration make it very appealing. Good job devops team. This is something I am going to spend time on."
"1070",2019-05-10 07:53:31,"planetcall","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","The fragmentation of config mgmt in #azure is bad. There is no way to change config in #ASF apps without redeploying while #functions and #webjobs expose config in the blade and through apis. Functions team brings keyvault integration with managed identity. ASF still lagging."
